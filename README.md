# apple.com
In this project,I tried to clone apple's official website, using html ,css and javascript . 
[Link to website](https://fidalmathew.github.io/apple.com/)

The website is fully responsive and, I have also added some functionality to the bag icon, just as it is present in the original website.

Thanks for reading, any suggestions for improvement will be highly appreciated.
